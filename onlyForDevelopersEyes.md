# bootstrapFoundationAutocomplete
Bootstrap and Foundations autocomplete plugin for Sublime Text 3

Idea:
  * Create an autocomplete feature in Sublime Text for Bootstrap and Foundations(if we can make it general, then I       guess we could easily add other frameworks and languages to the plugin).
    Example:
      Link: http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/completions.html
  * An info hover above the selected class name(for example, when we type substr() and click some ramdom key we must     get a hover above it or some corner of the screen, about the various details about the function. As we are making     it for CSS we must have this functionality to classes).
  * ........more to come(if above is completed successfully).



Work:
  * Read through both the JavascriptFunctions and AndyPython(links given by Ananya)
  * Search for how Sublime Text implements it autocomplete feature(could lookup for other autocomplete plugin build      by others)
        Link : http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/completions.html
        Just read through the above link and you will understand hwo we can implement the autocomplete feature by            just adding the triggers and their expansion in the default Sublime Text(User's Default)
  * Search how to create the hover functionality(Currently,I have to idea about that).
  * How to compile all the above code created into a single Sublime Text 3 plugin package(Also how to add them to         Sublime Text official plugins list).
  * Also keep looking for some cool ideas to be added in Sublime Text(there are already like a huge plugin             collections, but more can be added).
